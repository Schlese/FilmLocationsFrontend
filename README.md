# FilmLocationsFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.

The app calls an external REST API to receive Filmlocations of San Francisco.
The locations are automatically loaded and displayed in a Table with Pagination.

When entering a search term in the input field above the table, the film
locations can be searched by their title.

## API URI
By default th API URI is set to `http://localhost:8080` but it can be changed in the
environment files of the Angular project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
